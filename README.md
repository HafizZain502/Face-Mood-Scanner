# Face-Mood-Scanner
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed README and a new repository name that captures the essence of your project on emotion recognition using machine learning.

### Suggested Repository Title:
- **EmotionSense-CNN**

### README.md Content:
# EmotionSense-CNN

## Introduction
Welcome to EmotionSense-CNN, a cutting-edge deep learning project designed to identify human emotions through facial expressions. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project aims to classify faces into two emotional states: happy and sad. Our goal is to enhance human-computer interaction, contributing to fields such as psychological research, security, and personalized content delivery.

## Project Objectives
- **Develop a Robust Model**: Build a CNN capable of accurately recognizing and classifying happy and sad facial expressions.
- **Address Real-World Challenges**: Ensure the model performs well across diverse conditions, including varying lighting, backgrounds, and ethnicities.
- **Open Source Collaboration**: Foster a community of developers and researchers interested in emotion recognition and machine learning.

## Installation
Before you can run the project, you need to set up your environment:



## Dataset
This project uses a dataset compiled from multiple sources, featuring over 10,000 labeled images of human faces expressing happiness or sadness. We ensure diversity in the dataset to mimic real-world scenarios as closely as possible.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used in EmotionSense-CNN includes:
- Sequential layers for a streamlined flow.
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
- Dropout layers to mitigate overfitting.
- Dense layers for classification output.

## Usage
To train the model or make predictions, follow the instructions in the `training.ipynb` notebook. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:
- Preprocessing data.
- Training the model.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Making predictions on new data.

## Applications
EmotionSense-CNN can be applied in numerous practical scenarios:
- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patient emotional states in real time.
- **Retail**: Adjusting ambient store settings based on customer mood.
